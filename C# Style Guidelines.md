## :book: C# Style Guidelines :book:

:construction: Under Construction! :construction:

The code should be easy to read.  Variable names should point out the type of the variable and be descriptive, but not too long.

Functions should be kept short and not too many empty lines should be inserted.

This style guideline should be improved during the next refactoring.
