## :book: Manuals Folder

The Manuals contains the Movie File Merger User Manual in MS Word format, which will be retired once the GitBook [Movie File Merger User Manual](http://modi777.gitbooks.io/movie-file-merger-user-manual/) is finished. 

Further it contains the screenshots for the descriptions in the Wiki and the GitBook User Manual.  The screenshots will remain in the Manuals folder until it is probably renamed to Screenshots folder or something similar.  :smirk:
