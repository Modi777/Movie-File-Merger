## :book: MFM Installation
Working with Dropbox is part of the current design of the program.  However the program can also work standalone, like from a memory stick or normal folder on the hard disk without Dropbox.  It is recommended to copy the whole folder that contains the executable and support files into a new folder, as the program when working will create the 2 ‘Collection’ folders on the same level as its own folder.  In this way it is easy to keep track of all the files that the program uses.

Double clicking on the program in its folder or starting it from a shortcut is all you need to do run it.  No further installation needed.

### System Requirements
MFM runs under Windows 7, 8 and 10.  MFM has also been used on a Mac with Parallels installed.

### :information_source: Other Programs
There are several other programs, like TeraCopy, MediaInfo or FilBot, used together with MFM.  All other programs can be downloaded and used for free.
