### Welcome to the Movie File Merger!
MFM is programmed in [C#](http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/) with [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx) version 5.0.0.  At the moment it uses the .net framework 4.0.  MFM runs under Windows XP, Vista, Win 7, and Win 8.  MFM has also been used on a Mac with Parallels installed. 
XP needs .net framework 4.0 installed and to handle the resizing of the windows, a program like PowerResizer is required.

The purpose of Movie File Merger (MFM) is to support the combination video collections, like movies, series, or documentaries.
MFM makes it easier for you to select which items are copied or moved and which items are not touched.  It only considers relevant
files and ignores the rest.
MFM helps you to select the items to copy before hand, and hence reduces the hassle of selecting the items when they actually
should be copied or moved.

MFM is not a movie database program; hence MFM is designed so that the lists can be easily updated once out of date.  MFM is
designed to run in Dropbox, hence makes it easier to share lists with other people, update the program, and store your settings
and lists in a save place.  MFM is also designed to work together with multiple other programs, which can be downloaded and used
for free.
