{"name":"Movie File Merger","tagline":"Merge movie collections on hard disks","body":"### Movie File Merger\r\nThe purpose of Movie File Merger (MFM) is to support the combination video collections, like movies, series, or documentaries.  MFM makes it easier for you to select which items are copied or moved and which items are not touched.  It only considers relevant files and ignores the rest.  MFM helps you to select the items to copy before hand, and hence reduces the hassle of selecting the items when they actually should be copied or moved.\r\n\r\nMFM is not a movie database program; hence MFM is designed so that the lists can be easily updated once out of date.  MFM is designed to run in Dropbox, hence makes it easier to share lists with other people, update the program, and store your settings and lists in a save place.  MFM is also designed to work together with multiple other programs, which can be downloaded and used for free.\r\nThe MFM Usage section explains how to work with MFM and frequent used third party programs.  The MFM Settings section explains the configuration of MFM; anyway there should be no need to change the settings.  The Collection Organization section describes contains guidelines about your collection setup and the usage of “clean up” third party programs used together with MFM, so that you get most out of the features of MFM. The installation of all recommended programs is explained in the Installation section.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nReinhold Lauer (@Modi777)\r\nJacob Gemzoee\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact reinhold.lauer@gmail.com.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
